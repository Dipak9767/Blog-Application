        "textBody": "Mould, a fungus that grows from airborne spores, usually develops in unventilated and humid conditions as moulds grow in moist conditions. Showers and bathrooms are especially prone to develop moulds due to their humid conditions. Moulds can also appear in other parts of your home, including bedrooms due to high humidity and lack of ventilation. Not only are moulds horrible stains on walls, but they are also not good for your health as certain moulds can be toxigenic which can produce toxins that can lead to respiratory problems and allergies. It’s important to remove them as soon as they appear.\n\nHere, we give you a few steps on how to remove mould from your walls. When it comes to moulds covering is not the solution – so don’t paint your walls, remove the mould and its source instead!",

        "title": "5 Psychological Benefits of a Clean Environment",
        "textBody": "Leading mental health experts suggest that there are many psychological benefits of living in a clean and tidy environment, which helps us to have better lives. Let’s have a look at some of these benefits.\n\nYou are more relaxed in a clean place\nComing home to a clean environment and coming home to a mess can have a very different impact on your mind. When you come home to a clean place, you feel more relaxed and at ease. Entering a dirty place can induce opposite psychological effects – that of stress and uneasiness.\n\nFor a more relaxing evening in front of the telly, reading, or doing whatever you enjoy, make your home clean and tidy.\n\nYou are more likely to get more done\nClutter and dirt can be overwhelming for the mind, leading to disruptive and unsettled behaviour. In an environment that is clutter-free and restorative you are more likely to see with clarity and get more done. Psychologically you will be less anxious, and this will produce positive hormones that enable you to achieve your targets.",

        "textBody": "When you wake up in the morning, make your bed. Leaving a tidy bed will have such a positive start to your day and coming home to a tidy room can feel even better at the end of a long day. Pick up your socks or items on the floor and make sure they are appropriately stored away.\n\nWhen you take a bath or shower, rinse after yourself. By rinsing bathtub or shower with hot water, and if necessary, with a cleaning agent, you reduce the build-ups and stubborn stains that are later difficult to remove.\n\nIn the afternoon\nWhy not do some light tidying and 10 or 15 minutes of vacuuming. You can choose just one room to vacuum each day you’re home early afternoon. You can also add in days to mop the floors in the bathroom and kitchen.\n\nBy not exerting yourself too much, you are more likely to stick to the routine and make it a habit, so we strongly recommend taking it easy by making these chores as light as possible.\n\nIn the evening",
